The MITE Open Source Community (MOSC) is a student-run organization affiliated with [Mangalore Institute of Technology and Engineering](http://www.mite.ac.in/) which renders learning in Open Source, Competitive programming, and multiple
trending technologies to the students of MITE.

##  PURPOSE
We at MOSC are devoted to creating and maintaining a tight-knit community among students interested in technology at MITE. Within this community, we aim to provide resources and opportunities for academic and career success, as well as an atmosphere for socializing and making friends. This code of conduct outlines our expectations for members within the MOSC, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be valued. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be outlawed from the community. 

## EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR

* Participate in authentically and actively. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this Club. 
* Attempt collaboration before serious disagreements or arguments.
* Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* Your work will be used by other people, and you, in turn, will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect collaborators and users, and you should take those consequences into account while making decisions. 
* We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't tolerable.

## UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOUR

The following behaviors are unacceptable within MOSC:
* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (doxing). Inappropriate photography or recording.
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances. 
* Any devices/equipment obtained from the community/college must be returned post use to the concerned members without any damage. If any the same must be notified immediately to a council member of the community, failing to do so will result in severe steps being taken against the responsible.
* Community event venues may be shared; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
* Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior will not be tolerated. 

## EXPERIENCING UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. If you feel you have been falsely or unjustly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the community council with a concise description of your grievance.
